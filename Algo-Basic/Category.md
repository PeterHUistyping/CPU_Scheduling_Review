- Online / Offline Algorithm
  - Offline: all jobs and their characteristics are known in advance (entire input available from the start)
  - Online may use heuristics from offline algorithm
  - Compare using Competitive Ratio
    - an online algorithm c-competitive if, for any sequence of jobs, the incurred energy is upper bounded by c times the optimum energy for that sequence.
- Continuous / Discrete Speed Model
  - Continuous: the processor speed may be set at any real value.
- Uniform / Variable Frequency Setting
  - Uniform: the operating frequencies of all the cores are the same. For such systems, when DFS is applied, the core frequencies are varied uniformly.
- Task Model
  - Periodic / Aperiodic
  - Preemption / Non-preemption
  - Migration / Non-migration
  - Common release time tasks
  - Agreeable deadline tasks
    - $ r_i \geq r_j  \implies d_i \geq d_j$
- Real platform
- Application area
  - Media
